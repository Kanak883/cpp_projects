#Library Management System
This is a small project created to revise my fundamental concepts in C++. It took me a week to complete, with at least **1-2 hours** dedicated daily.
Throughout the project, I relied solely on **StackOverflow and my notes**, avoiding the use of AI tools like ChatGPT, Phind, Gemeini or something. 
Each line of code was written independently based on my understanding and learning.

##Project Overview
Purpose: To revise and reinforce basic C++ concepts.
Development Time: Approximately 1 week (1-2 hours daily).
Resources Used: StackOverflow, personal notes.

##Limitations
Unfortunately, I was unable to implement file handling options such as editing text files or providing additional functionalities.
These features were beyond the scope of this project but are planned for future improvements.

##Future Plans
In my next C++ project, I plan to incorporate the following:

###File handling operations
###Enhanced functionalities and options
